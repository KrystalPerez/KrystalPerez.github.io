OMV: OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEOS

My idea for my website I have had for a while now but have not been able to pursue it because I did not have experience. I want this website to be one that I can continue to change as I learn more. 

The website I would like to create is of official music and lyric videos by artists (differs from youtube because it only shows official videos). Website is intended for users to create music video playlists which they can use for entertainment purposes. 

Videos can be used to view on laptop with small group of friends OR you can link your computer to a TV to view with a larger group. (like websites DJs use to play videos) Can view playlist continuously or if having a party you can create the playlist as you go.
